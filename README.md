# The new Guid API

Solution meant to provide new guids whenever requested.

Sure, this is also possible via the major search engines, by searching for `new guid` or something similar, but over there you need to select it in the UI before you can copy it.

This service only returns a new guid by invoking the site.

# Sample usage

GET https://guid.codes/
